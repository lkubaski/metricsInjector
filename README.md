A tool to populate the "Service Community Scorecard" dashboard for a Salesforce Lightning Community.

I created this tool to learn NW.js (https://nwjs.io): note that this tool requires the "Allow Salesforce Internal QA Clients" org perm to be enabled,
meaning that it will not work on a production org.
